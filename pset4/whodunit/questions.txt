1.  stdint.h is the header file that declares some integers of a specific width.
2.  to specify the size of each data type. Also, unsigned int (e.g uint8_t) ensures that the integer is positive only.
3.  BYTE is 1 byte, DWORD is 4 bytes, LONG is 4 bytes, WORD is 2 bytes.
4.  first two bytes contains the WORD bfType, "424df6" in hexadecimal, and "BM" in ASCII.
5.  bfSize specifees the size of the bitmap file on disk, biSize is the size of the info header.
6.  the image is upside down compared to a conventional bitmap?
7.  biBitCount
8.  if the file doesn't exist, it can't open and returns NULL
9.  because we take the size of the entire BITMAPINFOHEADER, and we need to read only that once. hence quantity is 1. 
10. 3
11. moves to a specific memory adress in a file.
12. SEEK_CUR denotes the currently read position of the file?
